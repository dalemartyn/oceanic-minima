# Oceanic Minima
## Color theme for VS code

Color scheme based on the awesome [Oceanic Next][1] by Dmitri Voronianski. Uses modifications from the [Charcoal Oceanic Next][2] theme. I have added the workbench colors that were introduced in VS code 1.12 ([reference][3]).

Works great with [Material Icon Theme][4] and the following settings: 

```
{
	"editor.fontSize": 12.75,
	"editor.renderIndentGuides": true,
	"editor.minimap.enabled": true,
	"editor.minimap.renderCharacters": false,
	"workbench.iconTheme": "material-icon-theme",
	"material-icon-theme.folders.iconsEnabled": true
}
```
